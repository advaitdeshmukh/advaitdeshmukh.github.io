Hello! I'm Advait Deshmukh, a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a keen interest in Natural Language Processing, specifically focusing on the limitations of current learning paradigms and working towards interpretability and explainability in LMs. 

I'm currently conducting research at the [BLAST Lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/) at University of Colorado Boulder, where I'm collaborating on various projects with [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/), [*September '25 Update: Our work on Ultra-Fine Entity Typing got accepted to StarSEM'25 [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17355) — Please reach out if you'll be attending EMNLP and would like to chat about open PhD positions in your lab :) or just say hi*]. I recently collaborated with [Rohan](https://www.rohandas.net/) on his work 'A Structured Clustering Approach for Inducing Media Narratives' (Submitted to ARR July '25 - no preprint out yet). These days I am exploring ways to improve generalizability of popular Event Causality Identification (ECI) approaches and reframe Entity Typing problem in context of longer narratives.

I have previously been involved in research at [BAIC Lab](https://baic.center/) led by [Dr. Tom Yeh](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/tom-yeh) where I attempted to enhance vision capabilities in large language models though knowledge distillation, contributing to the advancement of multimodal AI research. 

For my research activities at CU I recieved the prestigious [Lloyd Botway Fellowship](https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/2023/02/14/lloyd-botway-mcompsci70).

I've been part of the instructional staff for "CSCI 1300: Intro to Computing" at CU since Fall 2023. After my work as a course manager for the class, I was a TA for the class in Fall 2024/Spring 2025. I was awarded the best TA award by the department for my work with 1300.

Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer in the Innovation Team at Societe Generale Global Solution Center in Bangalore, where I contributed to the development of cutting-edge technological solutions, including a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chat system. I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, where I gained a strong foundation in computer science and AI. 

In addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I am passionate about reading books, playing chess, and ~~painting~~ cat-sitting, which provide me with a creative outlet and a way to unwind. If you're interested in connecting or discussing potential collaborations, please feel free to reach out to me at advait.deshmukh@colorado.edu
