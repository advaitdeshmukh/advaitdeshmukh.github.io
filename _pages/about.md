Hi! I’m Advait, a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder with a primary research interests in Natural Language Processing. I aim to leverage interpretability tools to study failure modes of language technologies and to make these systems more robust by instilling linguistically and cognitively informed inductive biases in them.

I'm currently conducting research at the [BLAST Lab](https://blast-cu.github.io/) at University of Colorado Boulder, where I'm collaborating on various projects with [Dr. Maria Pacheco](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/). I was recently in Suzhou to present my [short paper](https://aclanthology.org/2025.starsem-1.15/) on entity typing at *SEM 2025 (co-located with EMNLP). I recently collaborated with [Rohan](https://www.rohandas.net/) on his work 'A Structured Clustering Approach for Narrative Schema Induction' (Recommended to ACL '26 in July ARR). 

These days, I am exploring ways to improve generalizability of popular Event Causality Identification (ECI) approaches with [I-Ta](https://doug919.github.io/) and reframing Entity Typing problem in context of longer narratives with [Maria](https://blast-cu.github.io/mlpacheco/).
<!-- 
I have previously been involved in research at [BAIC Lab](https://baic.center/) led by [Dr. Tom Yeh](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/tom-yeh). -->

In addition to my professional and academic pursuits, I like reading books, playing chess, and ~~painting~~ cat-sitting.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
